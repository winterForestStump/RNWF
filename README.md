# Repo for the Russian National Welfare Fund (RNWF) data. 

The size, structure and data on the dynamics of the fund are provided from the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation (MinFin) in plain text format on a monthly basis. Despite the significant volume of the fund, the data is poorly structured, which makes it difficult to analyze. The main purpose of this repository is to present the RNWF data in a form that is easy to understand and analyze.

The basic regulatory document of the RNWF is [Decree #18 from January 19, 2008](https://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_74298/92d969e26a4326c5d02fa79b8f9cf4994ee5633b/) of the Government of Russian Federation 'On the Procedure for managing funds of the National Wealth Fund' and '[Requirements to financial assets](https://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_74298/7bc757f5e7b23b669abc3e59d4b3a56e9a7307ba/) in which resources of the NWF can be placed.
